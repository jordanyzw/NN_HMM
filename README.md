#Neural Network Hidden markov model

1.use  hidden markov model to label the training dataset  and all do long action then plot the cumulative profit of each result. When the cumulative reward is larger than zero we decide to do long action if neural model classify the test data as the state correspongding to that reward and   vice versa.
2. we find that the result is profitable in the IF data.
